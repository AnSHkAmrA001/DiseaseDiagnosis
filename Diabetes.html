            <h2>About Diabetes Mellitus</h2>
            <p>Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) resulting from defects in insulin production, insulin action, or both. There are several types of diabetes, including type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Types of Diabetes</h2>
            <ul class="diabetes-list">
                <li>Type 1 Diabetes: An autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, leading to insulin deficiency.</li>
                <li>Type 2 Diabetes: A metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance, where cells do not respond effectively to insulin, and progressive insulin deficiency over time.</li>
                <li>Gestational Diabetes: A type of diabetes that occurs during pregnancy, typically in the second or third trimester, and increases the risk of complications for both the mother and baby.</li>

            <h2>Management of Diabetes</h2>

            <ul class="management-list">
                <li>Insulin therapy for type 1 diabetes and sometimes for type 2 diabetes</li>
                <li>Oral medications to lower blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity</li>
                <li>Dietary changes, such as limiting carbohydrates and sugar intake, and focusing on balanced meals</li>
                <li>Regular physical activity to improve blood sugar control, weight management, and overall health</li>
