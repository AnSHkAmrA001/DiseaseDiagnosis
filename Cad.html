            <h2>About Coronary Artery Disease</h2>
            <p>Coronary artery disease (CAD), also known as ischemic heart disease or coronary heart disease, is the most common type of heart disease. It occurs when the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart muscle become narrowed or blocked by a buildup of plaque, leading to reduced blood flow to the heart.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Causes of Coronary Artery Disease</h2>
            <p>The main cause of coronary artery disease is atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the accumulation of plaque (composed of cholesterol, fatty substances, calcium, and other substances) on the inner walls of the coronary arteries. Several risk factors contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease, including:</p>
            <ul class="causes-list">
                <li>High blood pressure (hypertension)</li>
                <li>High cholesterol levels (hypercholesterolemia)</li>
                <li>Smoking</li>
                <li>Obesity</li>
                <li>Physical inactivity</li>
                <li>Diabetes mellitus</li>
                <li>Family history of heart disease</li>
                <li>Aging</li>
                <li>Stress</li>
                <li>Unhealthy diet</li>

            <h2>Symptoms of Coronary Artery Disease</h2>
            <p>The symptoms of coronary artery disease can vary depending on the severity of the condition and whether there is a partial or complete blockage of the coronary arteries. Common symptoms include:</p>
            <ul class="symptoms-list">
                <li>Chest pain or discomfort (angina) - typically felt as pressure, squeezing, burning, or tightness in the chest</li>
                <li>Shortness of breath</li>
                <li>Fatigue</li>
                <li>Weakness</li>
                <li>Nausea</li>
                <li>Indigestion or heartburn</li>
                <li>Pain or discomfort in the neck, jaw, throat, back, or arms (more common in women)</li>
