            <h2>About COPD</h2>
            <p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disease that makes it difficult to breathe. It encompasses several conditions, including emphysema and chronic bronchitis. COPD is characterized by airflow obstruction, which typically worsens over time.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Causes of COPD</h2>
            <p>COPD is primarily caused by long-term exposure to irritants that damage the lungs and airways. Common causes and risk factors include:</p>
            <ul class="causes-list">
                <li>Cigarette smoking</li>
                <li>Exposure to secondhand smoke</li>
                <li>Occupational exposure to dust, chemicals, or fumes</li>
                <li>Air pollution</li>
                <li>Genetic factors</li>
                <li>Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (a rare genetic condition)</li>
            </ul>

            <ul class="diagnosis-list">
                <li>Medical history and physical examination</li>
                <li>Spirometry test to measure lung function</li>
                <li>Chest X-ray or CT scan</li>
                <li>Arterial blood gas analysis</li>
                <li>Lung function tests (e.g., diffusion capacity)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Treatment for COPD</h2>
            <p>Treatment for COPD aims to relieve symptoms, improve quality of life, and slow disease progression. Common treatment options include:</p>
            <ul class="treatment-list">
                <li>Smoking cessation</li>
                <li>Inhalers (bronchodilators and corticosteroids)</li>
                <li>Pulmonary rehabilitation</li>
                <li>Oxygen therapy</li>
                <li>Medications to reduce exacerbations and manage symptoms</li>
                <li>Surgery (e.g., lung volume reduction surgery, lung transplant)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Prevention of COPD</h2>
