            <p>Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by sudden and severe attacks of pain, swelling, redness, and tenderness in the joints, often affecting the big toe. It is caused by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood, which can lead to the formation of urate crystals in the joints and surrounding tissues.</p>
