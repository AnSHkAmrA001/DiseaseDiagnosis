        <div class="section">
            <h2>About Hyperthyroidism</h2>
            <p>Hyperthyroidism, also known as overactive thyroid, is a condition characterized by the excessive production of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland. Thyroid hormones regulate metabolism and affect various bodily functions. When thyroid hormone levels are elevated, it can lead to a range of symptoms and complications.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Causes of Hyperthyroidism</h2>
            <p>Hyperthyroidism can be caused by various factors, including:</p>
            <ul class="causes-list">
                <li>Graves' disease: An autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid gland, leading to excessive hormone production.</li>
                <li>Thyroid nodules or goiter: Abnormal growths or enlargement of the thyroid gland that produce excess thyroid hormones.</li>
                <li>Thyroiditis: Inflammation of the thyroid gland, which can result in temporary hyperthyroidism.</li>
                <li>Excessive iodine intake: Consuming too much iodine through diet, supplements, or medications can cause hyperthyroidism.</li>
                <li>Medications: Certain medications, such as thyroid hormone replacement therapy or iodine-containing medications, can trigger hyperthyroidism.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Symptoms of Hyperthyroidism</h2>
            <p>The symptoms of hyperthyroidism can vary in severity and may include:</p>
            <ul class="symptoms-list">
                <li>Unintentional weight loss</li>
                <li>Rapid or irregular heartbeat (palpitations)</li>
                <li>Increased appetite</li>
                <li>Nervousness or anxiety</li>
                <li>Tremors or shaking hands</li>
                <li>Heat intolerance and excessive sweating</li>
                <li>Frequent bowel movements or diarrhea</li>
                <li>Weakness and fatigue</li>
                <li>Difficulty sleeping</li>
                <li>Thinning of hair or hair loss</li>
                <li>Changes in menstrual patterns (in women)</li>
                <li>Enlargement of the thyroid gland (goiter)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Diagnosis of Hyperthyroidism</h2>
            <p>Diagnosing hyperthyroidism typically involves a combination of medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. Diagnostic tests may include:</p>
            <ul class="diagnosis-list">
                <li>Thyroid function tests: Blood tests to measure levels of thyroid hormones (T3, T4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).</li>
                <li>Radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) test: A nuclear medicine scan to evaluate thyroid function and iodine uptake.</li>
                <li>Thyroid ultrasound: Imaging test to assess the size and structure of the thyroid gland and detect nodules or abnormalities.</li>
                <li>Thyroid scan: Nuclear imaging test using a radioactive tracer to evaluate thyroid function and detect abnormalities.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Treatment for Hyperthyroidism</h2>
            <p>Treatment for hyperthyroidism aims to normalize thyroid hormone levels, alleviate symptoms, and prevent complications. Treatment options may include:</p>
            <ul class="treatment-list">
                <li>Antithyroid medications: Medications such as methimazole or propylthiouracil (PTU) to inhibit thyroid hormone production.</li>
                <li>Radioactive iodine therapy (RAI): Oral administration of radioactive iodine to destroy thyroid cells and reduce hormone production.</li>
                <li>Thyroidectomy: Surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid gland, particularly for large goiters or severe hyperthyroidism.</li>
                <li>Beta-blockers: Medications to control symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, tremors, and anxiety.</li>
                <li>Supportive care: Treatment of complications and management of symptoms, including monitoring and adjustment of thyroid hormone levels.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Complications of Hyperthyroidism</h2>
            <p>Untreated or poorly controlled hyperthyroidism can lead to various complications, including:</p>
            <ul class="complications-list">
                <li>Thyroid storm: A life-threatening condition characterized by severe symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, high fever, and confusion.</li>
                <li>Heart problems: Increased risk of atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and other cardiovascular complications.</li>
                <li>Osteoporosis: Loss of bone density and increased risk of fractures due to elevated thyroid hormone levels.</li>
                <li>Eye problems: Graves' ophthalmopathy, a condition characterized by eye inflammation, bulging eyes (exophthalmos), and vision changes.</li>
                <li>Thyroid nodules or cancer: Increased risk of developing thyroid nodules or thyroid cancer, especially in cases of long-standing hyperthyroidism.</li>
            </ul>
