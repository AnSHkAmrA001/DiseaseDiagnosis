        <div class="section">
            <h2>About Hypothyroidism</h2>
            <p>Hypothyroidism, also known as underactive thyroid, is a condition characterized by inadequate production of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland. Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in regulating metabolism, energy production, and various bodily functions. When thyroid hormone levels are low, it can lead to a range of symptoms and complications.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Causes of Hypothyroidism</h2>
            <p>Hypothyroidism can be caused by various factors, including:</p>
            <ul class="causes-list">
                <li>Autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's thyroiditis): An autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system attacks the thyroid gland, leading to inflammation and impaired hormone production.</li>
                <li>Iodine deficiency: Inadequate intake of iodine, a key component of thyroid hormones, can result in hypothyroidism.</li>
                <li>Thyroid surgery or radiation therapy: Surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid gland (thyroidectomy) or radiation therapy for thyroid cancer can lead to decreased hormone production.</li>
                <li>Medications: Certain medications, such as lithium, amiodarone, and some anti-thyroid medications, can interfere with thyroid function.</li>
                <li>Concurrent medical conditions: Certain medical conditions, such as pituitary disorders, hypothalamic disorders, or thyroid hormone resistance, can lead to hypothyroidism.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Symptoms of Hypothyroidism</h2>
            <p>The symptoms of hypothyroidism can vary in severity and may include:</p>
            <ul class="symptoms-list">
                <li>Fatigue and weakness</li>
                <li>Weight gain or difficulty losing weight</li>
                <li>Constipation</li>
                <li>Dry skin and hair</li>
                <li>Cold intolerance</li>
                <li>Joint pain and stiffness</li>
                <li>Muscle cramps</li>
                <li>Depression or mood changes</li>
                <li>Memory problems and difficulty concentrating</li>
                <li>Irregular menstrual periods (in women)</li>
                <li>Hoarseness or voice changes</li>
                <li>Swelling of the thyroid gland (goiter)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Diagnosis of Hypothyroidism</h2>
            <p>Diagnosing hypothyroidism typically involves a combination of medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. Diagnostic tests may include:</p>
            <ul class="diagnosis-list">
                <li>Thyroid function tests: Blood tests to measure levels of thyroid hormones (T3, T4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).</li>
                <li>Thyroid ultrasound: Imaging test to assess the size and structure of the thyroid gland and detect nodules or abnormalities.</li>
                <li>Thyroid antibody tests: Blood tests to detect antibodies associated with autoimmune thyroiditis (e.g., thyroid peroxidase antibodies, thyroglobulin antibodies).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Treatment for Hypothyroidism</h2>
            <p>Treatment for hypothyroidism aims to restore normal thyroid hormone levels and alleviate symptoms. Treatment options may include:</p>
            <ul class="treatment-list">
                <li>Thyroid hormone replacement therapy: Oral administration of synthetic thyroid hormone (levothyroxine) to supplement inadequate hormone production.</li>
                <li>Regular monitoring and adjustment of medication dosage based on thyroid function tests and symptom improvement.</li>
                <li>Healthy lifestyle habits, including balanced nutrition, regular exercise, stress management, and adequate sleep.</li>
                <li>Avoidance of iodine deficiency and excessive iodine intake through diet and supplementation.</li>
                <li>Management of complications and associated medical conditions, such as heart disease, high cholesterol, or infertility.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Complications of Hypothyroidism</h2>
            <p>Untreated or poorly controlled hypothyroidism can lead to various complications, including:</p>
            <ul class="complications-list">
                <li>Myxedema: Severe hypothyroidism characterized by extreme fatigue, mental sluggishness, and cold intolerance.</li>
                <li>Cardiovascular problems: Increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, and elevated cholesterol levels.</li>
                <li>Infertility and pregnancy complications: Hypothyroidism can affect fertility and increase the risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, and developmental problems in newborns.</li>
                <li>Myxedema coma: A life-threatening condition characterized by severely low thyroid hormone levels, resulting in unconsciousness, hypothermia, and organ failure.</li>
                <li>Mental health issues: Hypothyroidism may contribute to depression, cognitive impairment, and impaired quality of life.</li>
            </ul>
