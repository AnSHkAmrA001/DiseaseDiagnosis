            <h2>About Hepatitis</h2>
            <p>Hepatitis is a medical condition characterized by inflammation of the liver. There are several types of hepatitis, including hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, hepatitis D, and hepatitis E. Each type is caused by a different virus, and they vary in terms of transmission, severity, and treatment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Types of Hepatitis</h2>
            <ul class="hepatitis-list">
                <li>Hepatitis A: Transmitted through contaminated food or water, or close contact with an infected person. Typically causes acute hepatitis and does not lead to chronic infection.</li>
                <li>Hepatitis B: Transmitted through contact with infected blood, semen, or other body fluids. Can cause acute or chronic hepatitis and may lead to severe liver damage, cirrhosis, or liver cancer.</li>
                <li>Hepatitis C: Transmitted primarily through contact with infected blood. Most cases of hepatitis C become chronic, leading to liver damage over time and potentially resulting in cirrhosis or liver cancer.</li>
                <li>Hepatitis D: Occurs only in individuals who are infected with the hepatitis B virus. Can exacerbate hepatitis B infection and increase the risk of liver damage.</li>
                <li>Hepatitis E: Similar to hepatitis A, transmitted through contaminated food or water. Usually causes acute hepatitis, but pregnant women are at risk of severe complications.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Symptoms of Hepatitis</h2>
            <p>The symptoms of hepatitis can vary depending on the type of virus and whether the infection is acute or chronic. Common symptoms include:</p>
            <ul class="symptoms-list">
                <li>Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)</li>

                <li>Abdominal pain or discomfort</li>

            <h2>Diagnosis and Treatment of Hepatitis</h2>
            <p>Diagnosis of hepatitis typically involves blood tests to detect viral markers and assess liver function. Treatment varies depending on the type and severity of hepatitis but may include:</p>
            <ul class="diagnosis-treatment-list">
                <li>Rest and hydration</li>
                <li>Antiviral medications</li>
                <li>Immunizations (for hepatitis A and hepatitis B)</li>
                <li>Liver transplant (for severe cases of liver damage)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Prevention of Hepatitis</h2>

            <ul class="prevention-list">
                <li>Practicing good hygiene (e.g., handwashing)</li>
                <li>Avoiding risky behaviors (e.g., sharing needles, having unprotected sex)</li>
                <li>Getting vaccinated (for hepatitis A and hepatitis B)</li>
                <li>Using precautions when traveling to regions with high hepatitis prevalence</li>
                <li>Seeking prompt medical attention if exposed to hepatitis or experiencing symptoms</li>
