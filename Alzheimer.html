            <h2>About Alzheimer's Disease</h2>
            <p>Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. It is the most common cause of dementia, a decline in cognitive function severe enough to interfere with daily life. Alzheimer's disease worsens over time and eventually leads to the inability to carry out even the simplest tasks.</p>

            <h2>Causes of Alzheimer's Disease</h2>
            <p>The exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Common risk factors include:</p>
            <ul class="causes-list">
                <li>Age (risk increases with age)</li>
                <li>Family history of Alzheimer's disease</li>
                <li>Genetic mutations (e.g., in the genes for amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 1, or presenilin 2)</li>
                <li>History of head trauma</li>
                <li>Cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity)</li>
                <li>Down syndrome</li>
                <li>Lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking, poor diet, lack of physical activity)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease</h2>
            <p>Diagnosing Alzheimer's disease involves a comprehensive evaluation of medical history, cognitive function, and neurological examinations. Diagnostic tests may include:</p>
            <ul class="diagnosis-list">
                <li>Memory and cognitive tests</li>
                <li>Physical and neurological examinations</li>
                <li>Brain imaging studies (e.g., MRI, CT scan)</li>
                <li>Blood tests to rule out other causes of dementia</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Treatment for Alzheimer's Disease</h2>
            <p>While there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, treatment aims to manage symptoms, slow disease progression, and improve quality of life. Treatment options may include:</p>
            <ul class="treatment-list">
                <li>Medications to improve cognitive function and manage symptoms (e.g., cholinesterase inhibitors, memantine)</li>
